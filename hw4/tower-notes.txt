No ambiguous puzzle seems to exist for a board with dimensions 3 x 3 or lesser. 
Here are a few ambiguous puzzles for higher dimensions (4 x 4 to 8 x 8, after this the predicate takes unreasonably long to execute):
4 x 4
ambiguous(4, C, T1, T2).
C = counts([2,2,3,1],[3,1,2,2],[3,1,2,2],[1,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,3,2,4],[4,1,3,2],[3,2,4,1],[2,4,1,3]]
T2 = [[1,3,2,4],[4,2,3,1],[3,1,4,2],[2,4,1,3]]

5 x 5
ambiguous(5, C, T1, T2).
C = counts([3,3,3,2,1],[3,2,1,3,3],[5,3,1,2,3],[1,2,2,3,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[5,3,1,2,4],[4,5,2,3,1],[3,4,5,1,2]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[5,3,1,2,4],[4,5,2,3,1],[2,4,5,1,3]]

6 x 6
ambiguous(6, C, T1, T2).
C = counts([4,3,4,2,2,1],[3,2,1,3,3,5],[6,3,4,1,2,3],[1,2,2,3,3,3])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[2,1,4,3,6,5],[3,4,5,6,1,2],[6,3,1,5,2,4],[5,6,2,1,4,3],[4,5,6,2,3,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[2,1,4,6,3,5],[3,4,2,5,6,1],[6,3,5,1,2,4],[5,6,1,2,4,3],[4,5,6,3,1,2]]

7 x 7
ambiguous(7, C, T1, T2).
C = counts([5,4,4,2,3,2,1],[3,2,1,4,2,4,4],[7,4,3,4,1,2,3],[1,2,2,2,3,4,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[2,1,4,3,6,7,5],[3,4,1,2,7,5,6],[4,5,6,7,1,2,3],[7,3,5,6,2,1,4],[6,7,2,5,3,4,1],[5,6,7,1,4,3,2]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[2,1,4,3,6,7,5],[3,4,1,2,7,5,6],[4,5,6,7,2,1,3],[7,3,5,6,1,2,4],[6,7,2,5,3,4,1],[5,6,7,1,4,3,2]]

8 x 8
ambiguous(8, C, T1, T2).
C = counts([6,4,4,2,4,2,2,1],[3,2,1,4,2,4,4,8],[8,4,4,2,4,1,2,3],[1,2,2,4,2,4,4,6])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7],[3,4,1,2,7,8,5,6],[4,3,2,1,8,7,6,5],[5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4],[8,5,6,7,2,1,4,3],[7,8,5,6,3,4,1,2],[6,7,8,5,4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7],[3,4,1,2,7,8,5,6],[4,3,2,1,8,7,6,5],[5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4],[8,5,6,7,2,4,1,3],[7,8,5,6,3,1,4,2],[6,7,8,5,4,3,2,1]]
